##### Verify your installations

Verify your installation by calling the executables `git`, `npm -v`, `node -v`, `ionic -v`, `ng -v`  in your shell. Your node and npm installation needs permissions feel free to read this to see what I am talking about: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions
